# little python projects for the kicks
 
over my 3 months break from collage i've worked on a telegram bot using python script and botfather

to avoid burnouts i did some little on the side games and stuff like:

tic tac toe
hangman
word/number guessing
voice recording
random facts site
rock paper scissors

and a function to find second largest element in array without sorting it

the tic tac toe needs some work i want it to work with GUI not in the terminal but i'll work on that when i have the time

all of them work on vs code terminal
